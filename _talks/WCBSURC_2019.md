Abstract: All cells within the human body maintain a resting membrane potential that arises from a gradient of sodium and potassium ions. We are developing voltage-sensitive fluorophores, or VoltageFluors (VF dyes) that provide a fast and sensitive optical read-out of membrane voltage. In this work, we synthesize and characterize new VF dyes based on the central principle of modulating conformational flexibility within the dye. The donor moiety of the dye was synthetically modified to yield compounds with differing levels of planarity and flexibility. Patch clamp electrophysiology and optical characterization reveal differences in voltage sensitivity correlated with conformational flexibility of the modified donor, which is further validated by computational calculations. These efforts may represent a new paradigm for improving VoltageFluor dyes.
