I am a 3rd year undergrad @ UC Berkeley studying Chemical Biology and doing research in the Miller Lab. My goals are to pursue a PhD in either Synthetic Organic Chemistry or Chemical Biology and eventually find a home in industry (or academia if I really do become a superstar!). My current research involves the synthesis of novel functional dyes for the sensing of voltage in membranes and I love it!. 

Feel free to reach out to me at therealsam@berkeley.edu
