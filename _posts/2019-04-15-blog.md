Hi everyone,

Today I just created this fresh new personal academic GitHub page. Of course I plan to put my CV, achievements, etc. on this website. But more importantly I hope that this site can eventually express my academic identity to the world. I'm really grateful to the people who made the  [template](https://github.com/academicpages) that I am using and I'm very happy with the page I have created so far. And to you my reader, welcome, thanks for coming, and Hello World.

-Sam
