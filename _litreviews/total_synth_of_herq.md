title: "Literature Review of Total Syntheses of Herqulines: June 2004 to February 2019"

excerpt: 'The Herquline family of natural products is a group of macrocyclic piperazines that display inhibition of influenza virus replication (Herquline A) and platelet aggregation (Herquline B). The central difficulties, and opportunities, of their synthesis are the formation of a strained biaryl C-C bond and the selective reductions of the dityrosine aromatic rings and amides. This literature review will focus on relevant PhD theses as well as the recently published work of the Wood group, the Baran group, and Schindler group (2018-2019) detailing the total synthesis of Herqulines B & C.'
